The Multiplayer of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II brings many changes compared the previous Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Multiplayer. One of the big changes is the complete revamp in the Gunsmith. Now weapons are grouped into “Platforms”, allowing for complete control over the weaponry that the player bring into matches. This allows the player to unlock new weapons and have attachments shared between weapons of a platform and universal attachments that will be shared for all weapons in the game.

The Perks system changed compared to past games. Now has a system called Perk Packages. This consists of four Perks, two base, plus two more known as a “Bonus” and “Ultimate.” All are earned during a Multiplayer match. Kills, assists, objective and tactical plays can unlock these more quickly.

The game also brings a realistic combat in the vehicles. Now, the player can destroy vehicle sections, like bumpers, doors and Blowing out tires. Different vehicles are available for use on the Ground War maps.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II also brings the possibility of Swimming and Aquatic Combat. Different of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, now the player will be able to swim. On the Ground War maps, there are also water vehicles that will allowed a better mobility.

The new movement options introduced in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, like Tactical Sprint and Mounting are back, and now with a new one added, the Dive to Prone, returning from past games, that works together with Sliding. Another new movement option, is the Ledge Hang, which this allows the player peek from a Mantle and look around.

Heist missions were initially added to Grand Theft Auto Online as part of the Heists Update, released on March 10th, 2015. They were later expanded, albeit in the enhanced versions of the game only, as part of The Doomsday Heist, The Diamond Casino Heist and The Cayo Perico Heist updates.

In terms of overall structure, they are similar to the heists found in Grand Theft Auto V, in that they involve a series of setup missions that culminate in a high-profit crime. However, unlike GTA V, heists are set up by one of the players taking part (dubbed the Heist Leader); this player has to pay a sum of money up-front to finance the job, but can also dictate how the final profits will be split among the participants.

“In the years since he and his accomplices knocked over the Union Depository, renowned Los Santos hustler Franklin Clinton has been making moves of his own.
Welcome to F. Clinton and Partner, a new “celebrity solutions agency” catering to the Vinewood elite in need of solutions to high-society problems.
Franklin needs two things: a reliable partner and a big-ticket, high-profile client. With your longtime LS contact — and newly aspiring cannabis entrepreneur — Lamar Davis making the connection, you can be the partner that helps Franklin take the business to the next level.
Meanwhile on the other side of the city, DJ Pooh has been reaching out to Franklin about an exciting potential client: his close friend, Dr. Dre.
Lost in the shuffle on his way to Cayo Perico last year, it turns out Dr. Dre’s phone isn’t just missing — it’s in the wrong hands. Not only that, but the phone also contains the hottest property in the city: new, unreleased music from Dr. Dre himself. This could be the big break your agency needs.
Get ready for a wild and hilarious ride through Los Santos, from the mean streets of Franklin’s old neighborhood to the hottest parties in the city, from debaucherous mansions to the offices of the FIB and everywhere in between as you join Franklin, expert hacker Imani, Chop the Dog, and crew to secure Dr. Dre’s precious tracks and return them to their rightful owner.”
