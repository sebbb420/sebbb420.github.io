What Is PlayStation?
- Playstation is a video game console developed by Sony. The first PlayStation was released in 1994, followed by PlayStation 2 (PS2) in 2000 and Playstation 3 (PS3) in 2006.
- I Currently have the PlayStation 4 (PS4) which was released back then in 2013, It is nearly ten years old but the PS4 still is in great condition and can handle most of all the games nowadays very smoothly.
